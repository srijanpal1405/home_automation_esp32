The development of smart homes and automation systems has become increasingly popular in
recent times, as homeowners seek to improve the efficiency and convenience of their living
spaces. One area where automation can be particularly useful is in the control of room lighting
and ventilation, which can have a significant impact on energy usage and occupant comfort. This
project aims to design and implement a room automation system using voice-controlled
commands and manual operation for controlling lights, fans, and a sensor to monitor room
statistics such as temperature and humidity.
The system is built around an ESP32 microcontroller, which offers powerful processing
capabilities, low power consumption, and built-in Wi-Fi connectivity. The microcontroller is
responsible for coordinating the various components of the system and executing user
commands. A speech recognition module is integrated with the microcontroller, which enables
users to control the system using voice commands. The module is trained to recognize simple
voice commands, such as "turn on the lights" or "increase fan speed."
In addition to voice control, the system also supports manual operation through a series of
buttons. These buttons allow the user to control the lights and fans directly, without the need for
voice commands. The buttons are integrated into a user-friendly interface, which makes it easy to
control the system and monitor the room statistics.
To monitor the room statistics, a sensor is integrated into the system, which measures
temperature and humidity. This information is then relayed to the microcontroller, which uses it
to adjust the lighting and ventilation settings automatically. The sensor data is also displayed on
the user interface, enabling users to monitor the room conditions and make informed decisions
about adjusting the system settings.
Overall, the room automation system using voice-controlled commands and manual operation is
a cost-effective solution for improving room comfort, reducing energy consumption, and
enhancing the user experience.
